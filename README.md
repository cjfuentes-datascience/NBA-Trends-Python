# NBA-Trends-Python

In this project, I’ll analyze data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and explore possible associations.

This data was originally sourced from 538’s Analysis of the Complete History Of The NBA and contains the original, unmodified data from Basketball Reference as well as several additional variables 538 added to perform their own analysis.

For this project I’ve limited the data to just 5 teams and 10 columns (plus one constructed column, point_diff, the difference between pts and opp_pts).

Let’s get started!
